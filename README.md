## Bank Churn Prediction with TPOT

### Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a bank using machine learning algorithms optimized through TPOT (Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool). TPOT automates the process of model selection, preprocessing, and hyperparameter tuning to build an efficient predictive model.

### Project Description
The goal of this project is to predict which customers are likely to churn using their demographic and banking data. TPOT is employed to automate the machine learning pipeline, optimizing preprocessing steps and model selection to achieve high predictive performance.

### Installation
To run the code, install the required libraries using:

pip install tpot

### Data
The dataset used is bank_churn_data  that is in train.csv and test.csv

### Algorithms
TPOT automates the optimization of these algorithms, including preprocessing, feature selection, and hyperparameter tuning.

### Results

The performance of the optimized model is evaluated using accuracy and other metrics. The results, including the best pipeline and model performance, are saved and can be reviewed
